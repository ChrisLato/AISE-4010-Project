Preprocessing:

We plan on taking select columns from the 4 datasets and combining them into a new dataset. The challenge is lining up the dates. 

From: "df_sex_unemployment_rates", use "overall_rate" column
From: "Federal Reserve GDP%, Unemployment, Inflation Rates, 1954-Present", use GDP% change percentage (formatting date may be annoying since dates are in sepearate columns)
From: "US_inflation_rates", use inflation rates
From: "US_Yield_Curve", use... yea idk yet
